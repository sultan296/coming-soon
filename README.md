# coming-soon-website

In this project I have created an engaging "Coming Soon" webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I walk you step-by-step through designing a visually appealing layout that includes a countdown timer, ensuring visitors are excited for the launch and I have learned how to incorporate background images, stylish typography, and smooth animations to enhance user experience.
